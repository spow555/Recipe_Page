	<h1>The perfect Brisket for Family and friends</h1>
	    <p>One of the nine beef primal cuts, brisket is a favorite type of 
	barbecue. The brisket muscles support about 60% of the body weight of a cow,
	so it has a lot of tough connective tissue. Slow cooking brisket melts the 
	connective tissue, turning this cut of meat into a tender, melt-in-your-mouth feast.</p>
